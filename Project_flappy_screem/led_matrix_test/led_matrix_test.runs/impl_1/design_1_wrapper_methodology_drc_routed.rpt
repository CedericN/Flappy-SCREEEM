2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on D_out_0 relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LEDG relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LEDR relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 354 control sets (vs. available limit of 4400, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
Related violations: <none>
