Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 428 control sets (vs. available limit of 4400, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
